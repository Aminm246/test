# Phase 1

## Create Recipe
    When the program is ran you are greeted with the create recipe page. This can 
    be filled out and submitted. Which then creates and adds this recipe to the manager.
    After creation the user can choose to view or create another. If the user chooses 
    to view the recipe, they can get back to the create page through the menubar. 
    
    Every section in the create recipe page needs to be submitted to be able to create
    the recipe. The image file path can be left blank when submitted. The tags section
    can also be left blank. 
## Read Recipe 
    After filling out the create recipe page and submitting, the user is given a choice,
    either view the recipe they created or create another one. When they click to view
    the page is populated with the recipe information they entered earlier.

    Submit a filled recipe and click Yes to view the recipe.

# Phase 2

## Delete Recipe
    This functional requirement allows the user to delete a particular recipe. The user must select the top left menu bar item 
    titled "Recipe", and then select "View Recipes", which will give the user a list of the created recipes. The user can then 
    select a particular recipe and be sent to a page which will show the details of the recipe. To delete the recipe, the user 
    must select delete button on the left side of the page. This will delete the recipe from the database and remove the associated 
    data for the recipe in terms of recipeIngredients, recipeTags, and the instructions for the recipe. This can be tested through viewing 
    the list of recipes to confirm deletion, as well as checking the database to confirm that associated data for the recipe has been
    removed from the database.
