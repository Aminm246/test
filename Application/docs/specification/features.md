# Recipes
- User can favorite certain recipes for quick access
### Pictures
- Picture of whole dish
- Pictures for intermediate steps
-  Images should be clickable and takes you to page that shows you the details of the recipe.

### Step-by-Step Instructions
- Each instruction will include the quantity, as well as being listed at the top.

### Scalability
- Scales the overall recipe, as well as the individual instructions. Making sure the user
doesn't have to go back to the beginning of the recipe to check the amounts again.

### Categories
- Different categories of dishes
- Allow the user the favorite certain categories, allowing better recommendations at the start of page
- Each recipe will belong to different categories or have different tags. (Beef,Pasta,High Carb, Low Carb,Paleo).
This will allow users to search by tag to find a larger variety of dishes than clicking through categories alone.

### Tags
- Similar to Categories but allows more customization by the user. Allowing tags like High Fat. Low Sodium.

### Calorie calculator
- The application automatically calculates nutritional information based on the recipe’s ingredients quantities and types.
- Users can adjust quantities and ingredients to better meet their nutritional goals.
- The application provides a nutritional breakdown in the following areas: 1.) Total calories 2.) Macronutrients: Carbohydrates, fat, protein, fiber, sugar, etc. 3.) Micronutrients: Vitamin A, B, C, etc.

### Meal Planner
-	Users can select recipes to make a meal plan for different meals throughout the week. The recipe provides the number of servings which can be mapped to different meals. 
-	The application can track whether the meal plan is meeting the user’s dietary goals using the calorie and nutrient tracker. Dietary goals can include areas such as total calorie count or grams of protein for the day. 
-	After selecting the recipes and making a meal plan, a grocery list is generated for any missing or required items.

# Grocery List
-   When a user selects recipe(s) they can generate a grocery list from them. It will also compare it to what ingredients 
    the user has on hand, if the user uses that function of the program.

# Ingredient Tracker

### Recipe Recommendation
- If you have your ingredients in the program, the program will be able to recommend recipes that you can make
with what you currently have, or with minimum additional ingredients.
- There could be two options, "strict" and "loose", where "strict" will only recommend recipes with the exact
ingredients that the user has. While "loose" could have a custom amount of ingredients that the user is willing
to purchase.
- Adding dollar amounts to ingredients, could also allow us to breakdown costs of recipes, as well as letting
the user decide how much money they are willing to spend, and then recommending a recipe based on that as well.
This could pose a complication depending on where or how we include the scalability function. A solution could
be breaking it down as cost per serving.
