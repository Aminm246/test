### Categories

- Allow the user the favorite certain categories, allowing better recommendations at the start of page

### Recipe Recommendation
- If you have your ingredients in the program, the program will be able to recommend recipes that you can make
with what you currently have, or with minimum additional ingredients.
- There could be two options, "strict" and "loose", where "strict" will only recommend recipes with the exact
ingredients that the user has. While "loose" could have a custom amount of ingredients that the user is willing
to purchase.
- Adding dollar amounts to ingredients, could also allow us to breakdown costs of recipes, as well as letting
the user decide how much money they are willing to spend, and then recommending a recipe based on that as well.
This could pose a complication depending on where or how we include the scalability function. A solution could
be breaking it down as cost per serving.
